/* Offline re-login, for a phone that has signed in before.
 *
 * Signing in fresh needs the Supabase server — the password lives there, and
 * no signal means no answer. But logging OUT and back IN on a shared phone in
 * a nursery with no line is a real morning, so the phone keeps what it can:
 * on every successful ONLINE password login, the session Supabase handed back
 * is stored SEALED UNDER THAT PASSWORD — PBKDF2 (SHA-256, 310,000 rounds)
 * derives an AES-GCM key, and only the ciphertext is kept, one entry per
 * email. Nothing readable is stored: without the password the entry is noise,
 * and a wrong password does not "almost" open it — GCM authenticates, so it
 * simply fails.
 *
 * Sign-out clears the LIVE session exactly as it always did. The vault entry
 * stays, because it is the whole point: at the login screen with no line, the
 * typed password either opens the sealed copy — and the person is back in on
 * their own credentials — or nothing happens. A phone that has never signed
 * in as that account has nothing to open, so the FIRST login still needs
 * signal; that is not a gap, it is the security model.
 *
 * Same file, same rules, in the Barcode_Counter (FC Portal) repository —
 * src/lib/offlineVault.js there. Change one, change the other.
